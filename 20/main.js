// Q20- Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list
//  of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a
//  program that creates a list containing these items?


// Making programing languages array
var programingLanguages = ["Typescript", "Javascript", "PHP", "Phython"];
// Print the message of list
console.log("List of Programing languages:");
// Print the value of array in the form of List
programingLanguages.forEach(function (language) { return console.log(language); });
